**Face Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning**


### Project Overview:
This project involves building a machine learning pipeline to classify images into two categories: **showing face** and **covering face**. The project utilizes deep learning models to perform classification and includes comprehensive preprocessing, training, validation, and performance logging mechanisms.

### Key Components:

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiekhburhan/face-mask-dataset

The dataset used is a modified version of the Kaggle Face Mask Dataset, which has been adapted to include only two classes. It contains 14,000 images, making it a substantial dataset for training and testing the models.

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Images are read from a dataset, resized to a uniform size, and preprocessed using Gaussian blur and other augmentations (rotation, flipping).
   - The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets based on configurable ratios.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: EfficientNetb0 
   - These models are trained using `torchvision` and `torch` libraries, leveraging GPU acceleration where available.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - A custom training loop is implemented to train models on the training dataset and validate their performance on a validation set.
   - The loop also tracks and logs key metrics such as loss, validation loss, accuracy, and the time taken per epoch.
   - During evaluation, metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, weighted error, and accuracy are calculated per class and overall.

4. **Logging**:
   - A dedicated logging mechanism is used to record the process of training, validation, and other key operations. 
   - The logs provide insights into the modelâ€™s performance and capture errors during execution.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The project implements error-handling mechanisms to manage potential issues such as missing folders, incorrect directory structures, and invalid file paths.

6. **Model Voting System**:
   - A voting classifier integrates the predictions of the three models (GoogLeNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet) to improve classification performance.
   - This ensemble approach provides a more robust classification by averaging the predictions from the individual models.

### Project Outcome:
The result of this project is a robust face detection and classification system that can be used for real-world applications such as security systems, ATM user verification, and monitoring.

### Tools and Libraries:

- **Python**, **PyTorch**, **Torchvision**
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Logging** for detailed logging of training and evaluation
- **sci-kit-learn** for data splitting and potential model evaluation
